      content="I'm a full stack developer, Brazilian, and passionate about programming. I have a degree in Digital Game Technology from PUC-Campinas. Since then, I have 5 years of experience in the industry and have developed my skills, which encompass various languages and technologies, including Java, Kotlin, Node.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Unity, React, Vue, SQL, and Bubble. In addition to my work as a developer, I also had the opportunity to work as a programming teacher for children and teenagers. I enjoy learning and taking on new challenges. I'm looking forward to being part of exciting projects and continuing to grow as a professional."
